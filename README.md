Code availability: see bci.R in this directory. ***NOTE*** The code is written such that you must specify the species for which you are running the code. It is designed so that identical analyses are performed for each species. Therefore, titles for figures MUST be checked to see that they are correct for the species being run. See comments in code for specifications on whether to use RHF or ZYG BCI for the species at hand.
